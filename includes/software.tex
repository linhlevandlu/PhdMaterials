\section{The software architecture}
The architecture of program is followed 3-tier model. There-tier architecture is an architecture that each tier is designed, developed and maintained as independent. The advantage of this architecture is intended to allow any upgraded or replaced independent between the tiers. When user want to change the requirements or technology of a tier, it will non-affect to other tiers.\\[0.3cm]
The architecture of three-tiers includes:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Data tier}: includes the classes which were designed for the data structure of program. It also provides the persistence mechanism to access the data.
	\item \textbf{Logic tier}: controls the functionality of application by performing detailed processing.
	\item \textbf{Presentation tier}: displays information related to user. It is a layer which received the require from user to program or return the result from program to user. 
\end{itemize}
