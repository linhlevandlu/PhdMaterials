	This document is working on the morphormetry and machine learning studied. In morphometry part, we introduce the techniques which are in image processing and morphometry analysis such as segmentation methods or dominant points method. At the end of this part is MAELab, a software is constructed to distribute the studied method on the insect. In the machine learning part, we present the basic knowledge of machine learning and deep learning, specially convolutional neural network (CNN). We also introduce about a CNN that we use to classify the image in context of this thesis.
