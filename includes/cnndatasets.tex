\chapter{Deep learning datasets for landmarking}
In deep learning, the dataset is a most of important field that "gop phan" to the success of deep learning. The collections the data is depend on the field of project. This chapter presents the deep learning datasets, specially, the biological datasets for landmarking detection in 2D images. 
\section{Facial keypoints problem}
In this section, we will present the datasets that have been built for detecting the keypoints (landmarks) on human face.
\subsection{CASIA WebFace}
Dong Yi et al. [] have proposed a semi-automatical way to collect the face images from Internet\footnote{http://www.cbsr.ia.ac.cn/english/CASIA-WebFace-Database.html}. The dataset includes 10575 subjects and 494414 images. Based on the database, a $11-$layers CNN was trained to illustrate the quality of the images. The accuracy was compared with the state of the art methods, such as: \textit{Deep Face, DeepID2}. (can not download)

\subsection{The Annotated Facial Landmarks in the Wild dataset}
Annotated Facial Landmarks in the Wild (AFLW) \cite{koestinger11a} is a dataset of annotated face images gathered from Flickr. The images recognize the human face with difference  information such as, pose, expression, age, gener. In total, AFLW contains 25000 annotated face images with up to 21 landmarks per image. This database is public at AFLW site\footnote{https://www.tugraz.at/institute/icg/research/team-bischof/lrs/downloads/aflw/}.
\subsection{Multi-Task Facial Landmark (MTFL) dataset}
Multi-Task Facial Landmark (MTFL) has been trained on the same database with \cite{}. It includes 5590 LFW images and 7876 other images dowloaded from the web.
Zhanpeng Zhang et al. [] proposed TCDCN dataset\footnote{http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/TCDCN.html}.
