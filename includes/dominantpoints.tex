\chapter{Dominant points}
In shape analysis, extracting features from the curves is an important step because in another way, we can re-construct the shape from the features. The term dominant points, also called as siginficant points, points of interest, corner points or landmarks is assigned to the points which have the high effect on boundary of object; their dectection is a very important aspect in contours methods because these concentrate the information of a curve on the shape.\\[0.2cm]
Dominant points can be used to produce a presentation of a shape contour for futher processing. The representation ...
In the content of this chapter, we will discuss about the methods to determine the dominant in digital image.\\[0.2cm]
There are many approaches developed for detecting dominant points and the methods can be classified into three groups follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Dectermine the dominant points using some significat measure other than curvature
	\item Evaluate the curvature by transforming the contour to the Gaussian scale space.
	\item Search for dominant points by estimating directly the curvature in the original image space.
\end{itemize}
